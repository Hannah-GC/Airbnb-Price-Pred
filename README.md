# Overview
The objective of the project is to compare the performance of multiple machine learning models to evaluate the performance of each on a given dataset.  The dataset used is the [Airbnb Price Dataset]([https://renate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#cite-renate](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupindersinghrana/airbnb-price-dataset/code)) found on Kaggle.  The dataset has various attributs which contribute towards its usefulness in a thorough ML project:

**Size:** The dataset has about 75,000 rows and 29 features before preprocessing.  Generally, more data is better when trying to build an ML model which can make accurate predictions.
**Features:** The features included in the dataset are of varying data types, including numerical, text, and binary values.  A variety of different features can contribute towards better predictions.
**Pre-processing potential:** While having clean data to begin with is convenient, it is still important to know how to work with unclean data.  Additionally, working through unclean data can lead towards a more thorough understanding of the data, since alterations need to be made with purpose.

As intended by the original dataset, the Log_price column (Airbnb price scaled by log base 10) was used as the target column, leading to a regression model.  The project was completed in a group of four people in accordance with the project requirements.  The contributions made by me specifically include the Decision Tree model and the SHAP diagram.
